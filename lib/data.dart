  'Nah this is a gud one',
  'I finally went out with my squad really after a long time. It was an amazing day, as i spent more time with my four bestfriends. Me, sara, jane and simran went for a movie and had a good lunch. A whole day shopping is a dream for every girl that too with her besties, trying clothes in fitting room,taking photos etc,. I felt very relaxed and happy walking in the free air and making fun with my friends.',
  'Even when i had a great time with my friends today, one thing really pissed me off. Sara was annoying to me the whole day as i was very close with jane. I dont really understand why she was so possessive about me being close with jane, rather she knows that she and I are best friends for life. This whole thing made me sad and sara being very mean to me.',
  "I'm so upset.I dont know where to begin.",
  "To start off, I think I completely failed my math quiz, while I know I should've studied.But what really made me mad was the note that Sarah slipped into my bag today. She said she was sad that I've been hanging out with Jane more lately and thinks that I don't want to be her friend anymore. I can't believe she thinks that, especially after talking with her for hours and hours last week while she was going through her breakup with her boyfriend.Just because I've been hanging out with Jane a little more than usual doesn't mean I'm not her friend anymore.She completely blew me off today,and when I told Jane, she thought that Sarah was being a drama queen.",
  "Today was a little better. I spoke with Sara last night asking if she wanted to have lunch with me today,just the two of us,and she agreed.I told her that just because I'm hanging out with Jane, it doesn't change anything about our friendship.She said that she knows that,but she just felt like the third wheel because she doesn't think that Jane likes her and because Jane and I have a lot of classes together. I told her not to worry about what Jane thought and that I'd talk to her about it. Sara felt a lot better, and after we spent the rest of lunch catching up on the latest gossip, which I missed!.",
